# Delegation Requirements

EigenDA operators start by first registering as an EigenLayer operator and meeting stake requirements. These requirements are evaluated on a per-quorum basis, relative to the weighting for each quorum:


<Tabs groupId="network">
  <TabItem value="mainnet" label="Mainnet">

    - Minimum stake floor: Each operator must have
      - at least 32 ETH to join the ETH quorum, or
      - at least 1 EIGEN to join the EIGEN quorum.
    - Congested operator set stake floor: When the global operator cap (200) is reached for the quorum, the joining operator must have more than 1.1X the quorum weight of the current lowest-weighted operator in order to replace that operator.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="holesky" label="Holesky">

    - Minimum stake floor: Each operator must have at least 32 ETH.
    - Congested operator set stake floor: When the global operator cap (200) is reached for the quorum, the joining operator must have more than 1.1X the quorum weight of the current lowest-weighted operator in order to replace that operator.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Details about how these requirements are enforced and the process by which DA nodes join a quorum for which they are eligible can be found at the [Registration Protocol Overview](../registration-protocol.md).


## Checking eligibility

In order to determine the current TVL of the top 200 operators for each quorum, please visit our
AVS page ([Mainnet](https://app.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/eigenda), [Holesky](https://holesky.eigenlayer.xyz/avs/eigenda)) and sort by `TVL
Descending.` Observe the first 200 operators listed for the quorum and the amount of ETH TVL
delegated to them. Please keep in mind that the AVS Page reflects the
operator stake on EigenLayer, which is used to update the EigenDA operator set
stake weights on a weekly basis (Wednesdays at 17:00 UTC), so the EigenDA stake
may lag the real-time EigenLayer stake by at most 7 days.
